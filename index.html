        <p>I am a first year student of code, however, coding is not where my story began. I grew up in Carmel, Indiana in a famliy of six. Being the youngest, 
            I saw my family members go into careers and business and healthcare. I followed suit and pursued my under graduate degree in business. After graduation I began my
            career at Pepsi Co working as a Small Format Sales representitive in Dayton, Ohio. I was then promoted and moved to Frito Lay Headquarters where I worked on the Global
            Procurment team for two and a half years. The work I was doing was important, however, I did not find passion in it. I then began taking online classes in coding and instantly
            fell in love. 
        <br>
        <br>
         Outside of work, I am an exercise enthusiast, a gamer, and a musician. I love spending time with friends and family and also enjoy time by myself.</p>
